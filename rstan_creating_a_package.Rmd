Introduction: 
In this vignette we will walk through the steps necessary for creating an R package that depends on Stan by creating a package with one function that fits a simple linear regression.

The rstantools package offers two methods for adding Stan functionality to R packages:

- rstan_create_package(): set up a new R package with   Stan programs

- use_rstan(): add Stan functionality to an existing R   package


```{r}
library("rstantools")
rstan_create_package(path = "rstanlm")
```
