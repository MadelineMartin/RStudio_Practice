```{r}

library("rstan")

library("tidybayes")
```

make a data frame that has two columns the first with “treatment” with values 
1 through 5 and the second with “response” with random gaussian values with a different mean for each treatment. So there are say 100 rows for each treatment, so the data frame frame has 500 rows total.

```{r}
data <- tibble::tibble(treatment = as.factor(1:5)) %>% # piping tibble(treatment) into mutate. tibble constructs a df
  dplyr::mutate( # allows you to manipulate dataframe
    treatment_mean = rnorm( # finding the treatment mean
      n = 5,
      mean = 10,
      sd = 1)) %>% # piping treatment mean into rowwise
  dplyr::rowwise() %>% # piping rowwise into do 
  dplyr::do({ # do applies a function to each group (in this case rowwise)
    treatment_params <- . # the df
    tibble::tibble( # constructing a df
      treatment = treatment_params$treatment, # putting treatment into the df
      treatment_mean = treatment_params$treatment_mean, # treatment_mean into the df
      value = rnorm( # response value
        n = 100, # using 100 random Gaussian distribution values around the mean
        mean = treatment_params$treatment_mean,
        sd = 3)) # with a sd as 3
  }) %>%
  dplyr::ungroup() # removes grouping done by group_by 
```


looking at a summary of the values in data

```{r}
data %>%
  dplyr::group_by(treatment) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(
    treatment_mean = treatment_mean[1],
    empirical_mean = mean(value),
    sd = sd(value))
```


plot of treatment and response

```{r}
ggplot(data = data,
       aes(x = treatment,
           y = value)) +
  geom_point(size = 1.2,
             alpha = 0.8) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Response of Each Treatment",
       x = "Treatment",
       y = "Response")
```

Fitting the data to a simple Bayesian model (brm)
formula: 
1. A dependent variable we want to predict
2. ~ that is used to indicate that we now give the other variables of interest.
3. insert that the dependent variable has a variance and that we want an intercept.

treatment_mean (dependent variable) ~ 0 (intercept) + treatment (variance)

```{r}
model <- brms::brm(
  value ~ 0 + treatment,
  data = data)
```

running model_w_prior

```{r}
model_w_prior <- brms::brm(
  formula = value ~ 0 + treatment, 
  data = data,
  prior = c(
    brms::prior(normal(10,3), 
                class = "b",
                lb = 0), 
    brms::prior(normal(3,0.5),
                class = "sigma"
                ) )
  # iter=8000,
  # control=list(
  #     adapt_delta=0.99,
  #     max_treedepth=12)

prior posterior plot

less data, greater error

smaller sd
