# Perhaps as an exercise, see if you can make a data frame that has two columns the first with “treatment” with values 
# 1 through 5 and the second with “response” with random gaussian values with a different mean for each treatment. 
# So there are say 100 rows for each treatment, so the data frame frame has 500 rows total.
